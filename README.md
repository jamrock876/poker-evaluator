#Poker-evaluator

Knowing me, this was probably a coding challenge I encountered in a book and I decided to solve it. 

Poker-evaluator is a cmd line program that randomly "Deals" the user a hand of 5 cards in which he/she can choose to swap some cards, swap all cards or stay with hand delt. Once the user is satisfied with the current hand, it is then evaluated and a description of the strength of the hand is given

Example:
lets say you are delt 10♥ 10♠ J♦ K♣ 5♦ and you choose to stay your output would look like
```sh
>>> You have a pair!
```


### Improvments
Just use it to make something crazy

suggestions include:
- Adding unicode symbol to make it more user friendly
- Creating a game where blackjack meets poker, user tries to beat dealer
- Enable users to play remotely in a real table poker situation
